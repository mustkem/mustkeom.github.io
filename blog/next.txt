Next js

Nextjs site tells about how we can make setup from scratch. However if we know our requirment already than we can 
select a biolerplate that they have made already. You can make this biolerplate as well But you may 
take a lot of time to add diffrent features. They have biolerplates like next and react, next with redux, next redux redux thunk like 
these. So Its up to you what setup or biolerpate you use. You have to follow their instructions and 
you are good to go. 

First step to start the project is to calculate the requirment. Like for example I need a biolerplate 
that should have react next redux and redux thunk So I can drectly donload from there repo and can start working.
